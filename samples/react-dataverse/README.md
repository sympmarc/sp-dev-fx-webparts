# Consuming Dataverse API using SPFx

## Summary

This project entails the development of a SharePoint Framework (SPFx) solution, designed to bridge the gap between Microsoft SharePoint and Dataverse. The main goal of the project is to enhance the potential of SharePoint by integrating it with Dataverse, a low-code data platform from Microsoft.

The SPFx solution will allow users to interact with data in the Dataverse environment directly from their SharePoint user interface. This allows for a more seamless and intuitive experience for end-users, who can access, manipulate, and analyze data without needing to switch between different platforms or applications.
