# Quick Links

## Summary

A demonstration of building a web part with a dynamic property pane, drag n' drop edit capabilities - I've built the Tiles feature of the default Quick Links web part, but made room for the option to implement the other 5 layouts.

## Features

This web part demonstrates a couple of nice skillsets for an SPFx developer, the idea was spawned after I heard someone suggest that the default quick links would be open sources - as it doesn't look like that's going to happen I decided to build part of it myself.

This demonstrates:

* Dynamic property pane that changes based on user input in the web part
* Fluent Drag 'n drop using 'react-sortable-hoc'
* Using PnP Reusable Controls (Icon picker and WebPartTitle)
* Styling Fluent UI components (please don't look at the actual CSS, but the principals of how to do it)
* Grouping of property pane properties


There are still loads of ideas that I would love to see implemented, but right now I don't have the time, so feel free to add contribute with the features as needed
