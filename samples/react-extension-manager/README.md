# Tenant wide extensions manager

## Summary

This idea came about after years of hating updating the properties of a tenant wide deployed extension, and thinking I was just bad a classic SharePoint, then during a community call I saw [Vesa](https://twitter.com/vesajuvonen) struggle as well and I thought "We have a modern app catalog, why can't we have a modern extension managing experience?".

Here it is, a modern extension manager, that allows you to easily enable/disable extensions, and update the properties of the extension.
