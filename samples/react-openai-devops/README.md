# OpenAI Azure DevOps Bot

## Summary

The SPFx web part is a SharePoint Framework web part that allows users to view recent tasks, bugs, and commits assigned to them from a specific project in Azure DevOps. The web part uses the Open AI function calling feature to determine the user's request and intention, and then processes the relevant function using the Azure DevOps API.
