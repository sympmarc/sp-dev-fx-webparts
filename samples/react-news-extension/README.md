# Targeted News using Microsoft Graph Open Extension

## Summary

This sample contains two SPFx web parts:

### User preferences web part

This web part allows users to save their preferences in the Microsoft Graph Open Extension. This means that users can access their preferences from any device or application that uses the Microsoft Graph.

### Curated news web part

This web part allows users to view news topics they care about based on the selected preferences. This is a great way to help users stay informed about the topics that are most important to them.
