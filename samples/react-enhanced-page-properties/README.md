# Enhanced Page Properties

## Summary

This is a web part that goes beyond the standard SharePoint Page Properties web part, offering expanded support for various metadata types and configurations. Effortlessly display key page details based on metadata files, providing a comprehensive view of your content. Streamline information management and enhance user interaction with this versatile and customizable web part.

Currently support following types:

- Single line text
- Multiple line text
- Choice (should enable multiple choices)
- Date

### Configuration

- **Title**: Allow to set the displayed title. The built in SharePoint Page Properties web part doesn't allow user to change the displayed title. It will always be **Properties**
- **Fields**: Allow to display multiple fields separated by comma (this will be improved in the future). It's already support multiple line type. The built in SharePoint Page Properties web part doesn't support it.

### Plan for next version

- Support taxonomy field view
- Support people field view
- Support lookup field view
- Support currency field view
- Support hyperlink field view
- Support image field view
- Improve web part configuration
