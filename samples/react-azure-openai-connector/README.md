# Using Azure OpenAI Connectors API

## Summary

This (__experimental__) web part, shows how to use the new feature (_in preview at the moment of building this sample_) Azure OpenAI Data Connectors.

The web part is calling the Azure OpenAI API, with a specific Data source configured to an existing Azure Search service that contains the Hotels index provided by Microsoft. The following screenshots shows how you can configure the connector through the new Azure OpenAI Studio. This is __NOT required__ for the sample, but helps to understand what the web part is doing behind the scenes.

First, you have configured your Search service (any tier except the free one) importing the Hotels data sample provided by Microsoft

Now, from the [Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/portal), in the _Chat playground_, you can configure your data connector:

Connect it to your Azure Search Hotels index:

Follow the assistant to create the Connector. Once is done, you can use chatGPT to find hotels using natural language:

The web part offers the same functionality, showing how to call the Azure OpenAI API, with a pre-configured Data source.

__Note__: this is an experimental sample, based on the preview of the Azure OpenAI service, and the preview of the Data Connectors. Ensure you check the _prerequisites_ section if you are planning to run this sample.

## Used SharePoint Framework Version

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.17.4-green.svg)

## Applies to

- [SharePoint Framework](https://aka.ms/spfx)
- [Microsoft 365 tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-developer-tenant)

## Prerequisites

- Your Azure Subscription has the Azure OpenAI service available. You will see this message if you try to add Azure OpenAI service in your Subscription (follow the link in the Azure portal to request access).

> Azure OpenAI Service is currently available to customers via an application form. The selected subscription has not been enabled for use of the service and does not have quota for any pricing tiers. Click here to request access to Azure OpenAI service.

- You have created an Azure OpenAI service in your subscription (create it in a US region, as some features may not be available in other regions)
- Grab the Azure OpenAI Key (go to your _Azure OpenAI service -> Keys and Endpoint_)
- You have configured an Azure Search service with at least a Basic plan (Free tier is not working with the Azure OpenAI Connectors feature), and have deployed the "Hotels" index that is provided as sample by Microsoft.
