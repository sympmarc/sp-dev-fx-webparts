# SPFx environment settings management

## Summary

**Disclaimer:** This is as much of a script sample as a SPFx Web Part sample.

When building SPFx solutions, a very common need is to have different settings for different environments.

Up until now I hadn't come across a good solution, that was until I came across [this](https://discord.com/channels/1095788595010338956/1161442618857762906/1161641642105774100) awesome comment from [Beau Cameron](https://twitter.com/Beau__Cameron), after asking his permission I have turned his comment into a sample.

The main idea is that you can create as many environment as you want, simply add a "settings.\<name>.json" file in the settings folder.

Using the scripts in the `Scripts.ps1` file you can easily setup your existing SPFx solutions to use this concept, and use the `Set-SPFxEnvironment -Environment <name>` command to switch between environments.
