## Prerequisites

You'll need a document library to store the responses

## Minimal path to awesome

* Clone this repository (or [download this solution as a .ZIP file](https://pnp.github.io/download-partial/?url=https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-webparts/tree/main/samples/react-json-form) then unzip it)
* From your command line, change your current directory to the directory containing this sample (`react-json-form`, located under `samples`)
* in the command line run:
  * `npm install`
  * `gulp serve`

> This sample can also be opened with [VS Code Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview). Visit <https://aka.ms/spfx-devcontainer> for further instructions.

## Features

> PLEASE DON'T ACTUALLY USE THIS IN IT'S CURRENT STATE!
>
> The way this is setup to save it to save a .json file in a document library containing both the forms config and the values, this is a very unstructured method of storing data! - you really should implement another save method!

 ---

You have the option to edit the raw JSON in the property pane, from here you'll also set the document library where the JSON files are stored

---

Another feature is conditional fields (only for some of the field types)

It allows you to show/hide fields based on other fields, for instance a "fill in" choice option!

![conditional fields](assets/Conditional%20field.gif)


---

Lastly of the field types I'll call out here is the "Group" field this allows you to 'group' fields in either direction (is also a way to add several fields side a conditional field)
