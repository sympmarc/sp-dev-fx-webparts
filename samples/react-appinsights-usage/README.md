# Application Insights not only a Dev Tool

## Summary

Application Insights provides telemetry data to monitor and improve application performance and user experience, while AB Testing, user flow analysis, and logging help in optimizing and debugging applications by comparing different versions, mapping user paths, and recording significant events. The 3 sample web part demonstrates web part functionalities to aid developers in integrating customizable components effectively.

Analyze in Application Insight

![UserFlow by Session](assets/SampleRouterUserFlow.png)

Query in Application Insights Count PageViews

```
pageViews 
| where name contains "Page"
| where cloud_RoleName contains "app-insights-spfx-webparts"
| where cloud_RoleInstance contains "SampleRouterWebPart"
| where timestamp >= ago(8h)
| summarize count()  by name
| render barchart 
```

![Page visit count evaluation](assets/SampleRouterEvaluation.png)

Query in Application Insights Average Page visit duration by PageName

```
customMetrics 
| where name contains "PageVisitTime"
| where customDimensions.PageName contains "Page"
| where cloud_RoleName contains "app-insights-spfx-webparts"
| where cloud_RoleInstance contains "SampleRouterWebPart"
| where timestamp >= ago(8h)
| summarize avg(value)  by tostring(customDimensions.PageName)
| render barchart 
```
